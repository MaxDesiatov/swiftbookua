## Непрозорі типи

## Opaque Types

A function or method with an opaque return type hides its return value’s type information. Instead of providing a concrete type as the function’s return type, the return value is described in terms of the protocols it supports. Hiding type information is useful at boundaries between a module and code that calls into the module, because the underlying type of the return value can remain private. Unlike returning a value whose type is a protocol type, opaque types preserve type identity—the compiler has access to the type information, but clients of the module don’t.

### The Problem That Opaque Types Solve

For example, suppose you’re writing a module that draws ASCII art shapes. The basic characteristic of an ASCII art shape is a `draw()` function that returns the string representation of that shape, which you can use as the requirement for the `Shape` protocol:

```swift
protocol Shape {
    func draw() -> String
}

struct Triangle: Shape {
    var size: Int

    func draw() -> String {
        var result = [String]()
        for length in 1...size {
            result.append(String(repeating: "*", count: length))
        }
        return result.joined(separator: "\n")
    }
}
let smallTriangle = Triangle(size: 3)
print(smallTriangle.draw())
// *
// **
// ***
```

You could use generics to implement operations like flipping a shape vertically, as shown in the code below. However, there's an important limitation to this approach: The flipped result exposes the exact generic types were used to create it.
